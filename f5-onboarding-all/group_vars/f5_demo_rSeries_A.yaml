    lacp_timeout: fast              # Skipped if lag_type=static. LACP timeout: 'fast' = short timeout (1 second)
    native_vlan: 2346                # VLAN assigned as native (untagged on this lag). Leave empty value to skip.
    trunked_vlans:                  # Tagged VLANs allowed on this lag. Leave empty value to skip.
