## iSeries physical interface definitions 
interfaces:
  - name: 8.0                                 # Physical interface name (slot 8, port 0)
    bundle: disabled                         # Bundling disabled â€” interface operates independently (required before trunk config)

## iSeries trunk

    trunked_interface: 8.0                    # Assign VLAN 2345 as tagged on interface 8.0
